Summary of the exploratory data analysis performed on the shopping dataset:
	1	Data Overview:
	  •	The dataset contains information about shopping behavior, with 3900 rows and 18 columns, 
      covering various attributes like customer demographics, purchase details, and more.
	  •	No missing values were found in the dataset, indicating complete data for analysis.

	2	Descriptive Statistics:
	  •	The average age of customers is around 44 years, with a range from 18 to 70.
	  •	Purchase amounts range from $20 to $100, with a mean of about $59.76.
	  •	Review ratings average around 3.75 on a scale of 2.5 to 5.
	  •	Previous purchases by customers range from 1 to 50, with an average of 25.35.

	3	Gender Distribution:
	  •	A histogram of the gender distribution shows significantly more male customers than female customers.

	4	Age Distribution:
	  •	The age distribution histogram indicates that the number of customers is fairly uniform across different age groups, 
      each ranging between 700 and 800.

	5	Category Analysis:
	  •	A pie chart of sales by category reveals that "Clothing" is the highest selling category, accounting for 44.5% of total sales. 
      "Outerwear" is the lowest at 8.3%.

	6	Item Analysis:
  	•	A horizontal bar chart of sales by items shows that "Blouse," "Jewellery," and "Pant" are the top three best-selling items.

	7	Revenue by Category:
  	•	Summarizing revenue per category, "Clothing" leads with $104,264, followed by "Accessories" with $74,200, 
    "Footwear" with $36,093, and "Outerwear" with $18,524.

	8	Customer Behavior:
  	•	A stacked bar chart of sales by gender and subscription status shows no female subscribers and that sales generated by male subscribers constitute nearly half of the total sales generated by males.
	
9	Correlation Analysis:
  	•	A heatmap of the correlation matrix for numeric columns shows very weak or no significant correlations among the variables, 
      suggesting a random distribution and potentially unrealistic data.

The analysis indicates a dominance of male customers, consistent purchase patterns across age groups, a preference for clothing items, and weak inter-variable correlations.
