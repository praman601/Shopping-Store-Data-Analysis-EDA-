                                # Shopping-Store-Data-Analysis-EDA
This repository contains the code and results of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on a shopping dataset. The dataset comprises information on customer demographics, purchase details, and behavior, encompassing 3900 rows and 18 columns. The primary objective of this analysis was to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and revenue patterns to inform business strategies and decision-making processes.

                                        Analysis Overview:
The EDA process commenced with data loading and cleaning, followed by descriptive statistics to understand the central tendencies and distributions of key variables. Visualizations, including histograms, pie charts, and bar plots, were employed to explore gender distribution, age demographics, category-wise sales, top-selling items, revenue per category, customer behavior patterns, and inter-variable correlations. The analysis revealed notable insights such as a predominance of male customers, a preference for clothing items, uniform age distribution, and weak correlations among variables. These findings can aid stakeholders in optimizing marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer engagement initiatives to enhance overall business performance.
